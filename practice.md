### Practice

1. For naming directories and files, use convention foo-bar

   Avoid foo_bar, foo bar, Foo bar, ...

2. For every if write its else also. (otherwise anomaly may happen when calling that code in a loop)

   Or, for setting value based on condition, first initialize it with a default value. 
   ```
   k = default_value
   if condition:
       k = updated_value
   ...
   ```
